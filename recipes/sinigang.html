    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sinigang na Baboy is a popular Filipino dish known for its savory and tangy flavor. It is a type of sour soup or stew typically made with pork, such as pork belly, ribs, or shoulder, along with various vegetables. The distinctive taste of sinigang comes from the souring agent used, which is commonly tamarind. However, other fruits and ingredients like green mango, kamias (bilimbi), or sinigang mix (a pre-made seasoning packet) can also be used to achieve the signature sourness.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 kilo pork (e.g., pork belly, ribs, or shoulder)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion (quartered)</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes (quartered)</li>
        <li>2-3 long green peppers (siling pang-sigang)</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons fish sauce (patis) or salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>1 packet of sinigang mix (optional, or use fresh tamarind)</li>
        <li>1 bunch water spinach (kangkong)</li>
        <li>1 medium radish (labanos), sliced</li>
        <li>1 eggplant (sliced)</li>
        <li>1 cup okra (optional)</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons oil (for saut√©ing, optional)</li>
        <li>1-2 green mangoes, or 1 cup fresh tamarind (for souring, depending on preference)</li>
        <li>Water (enough to cover the ingredients in the pot)</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons sugar (optional, to balance the sourness)</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot, bring water to a boil and add the pork. Let it cook for about 30-40 minutes or until the pork becomes tender.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and tomatoes to the pot, and simmer for another 5-10 minutes until the vegetables soften.</li>
        <li>Add the sinigang mix (or fresh tamarind) to the pot and stir. If using fresh tamarind or other souring agents, mash them and strain the juice into the pot.</li>
        <li>Season the broth with fish sauce (patis) or salt to taste. Add sugar to balance the sourness if desired.</li>
        <li>Add the long green peppers and let the broth simmer for another 2-3 minutes to infuse the flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables like radish, eggplant, and okra. Continue to simmer until the vegetables are cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the water spinach (kangkong) and cook for another 2 minutes, just until the leaves are tender.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed (add more salt, fish sauce, or souring agent as preferred).</li>
        <li>Serve hot with steamed rice and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
